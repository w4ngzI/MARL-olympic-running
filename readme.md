The best-performing results are generated from files in olympic_strategy folder, and the best models are also in this folder. Please follow README.md in olympic_strategy folder to run the codes.



As for other attempts, including changing algorithms and reward mechanisms, we put all the codes in olympic_running_algo&reward folder. We also provide README.md in that folder to show how to run the codes.
